   # Set the variables as required in your preferred editor
   # For example I use Vim and I would have the following
   vim .env
   ```

3. Create a development build

- Ensure that you have setup the relevant build environment for an android|ios emulator.

- ios: Use xcode to download the latest version of ios and create an iPhone emulator device.
